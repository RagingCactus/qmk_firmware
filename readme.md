# My QMK fork

This is my personal QMK fork based on the `master` branch (at the time of writing).

If some code in here is useful to you (such as, for example, my Lotus58 firmware) feel free to use it!

However, I provide absolutely no warranty.
I may also not update this repository a lot, as I usually push to another, private, repository.

This also means that while you are encouraged to file issues or PRs if you think that might be useful to me or someone else, I can't guarantee that I will resolve/merge them.
